<h2><a href="#1">Why this site?</a></h2>
<p>
  The truth is, I started this site because I was dead curious about a new forum plaform that was recently released. Its called <a href="http://discourse.org">discourse</a> and its by one of the guys who founded stackoverflow so I really have high hopes for it.
</p>
<p>
  I have been interested in building an online community for a while but never really knew how to start.  Seeing discourse got me pretty excited as it seemed like just the tool I needed.  These are early days so it might be a while before I can tell if it works or not.

<h2><a href="#18">The future</a></h2>
<p>At some point I will offer people the option to host a branded discourse forum on my servers.  Contact me if you think this could be interesting for you.</p>
<p>You can leave me a message using the forum or just give me a call - 0034 672 550 305.</p>
